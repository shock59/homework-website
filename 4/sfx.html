        <h1>Sound Effects</h1>
        <p>Here are sounds I recorded around the house, along with some contexts they could be used in in a movie.</p>
        
        <h3>Pencil</h3>
        <p>This sound could be used for someone sawing wood. It might sound more realistic if chunked out slower.</p>
        <audio src="audio/pencil.mp3" controls></audio>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        
        <h3>Chopping Onions</h3>
        <p>This sound could also be used as an effect for scissor chopping, rather than a kitchen knife.</p>
        <audio src="audio/Onions.mp3" controls></audio>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        
        <h3>Kettle</h3>
        <p>This sound could be used as a heavy rain background noise. This would be useful in a real life movie if it isn't raining when you need it to.</p>
        <audio src="audio/Kettle.mp3" controls></audio>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        
        <h3>Ice Cube Tray Empty</h3>
        <p>This sound could be used as a sound for something smashing or crunching.</p>
        <audio src="audio/IceCubes.mp3" controls></audio>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        
        <h3>Door Closing</h3>
        <p>This sound is quite loud, so it could be used as a big boot stomping.</p>
        <audio src="audio/Door.mp3" controls></audio>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        
        <h3>Cooking (Pot on Stove)</h3>
        <p>This sound could be used for rain, too, but light rainfall instead of heavy as the sound is quieter.</p>
        <audio src="audio/Cooking.mp3" controls></audio>
        <p> &nbsp; </p>
        
        <h3>Blinds Chain</h3>
        <p>I couldn't think of a good use for this one, so I edited it and made it sound like a larger chain, which could be used for something like an old drawbridge opening.</p>
        <h4>Old Sound: <audio src="audio/BlindsOld.mp3" controls></audio></h4>
        <h4>New Sound: <audio src="audio/Blinds.mp3" controls></audio></h4>
