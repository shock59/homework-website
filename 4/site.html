        <h1>My Google Site</h1>
        <p>I have created a new website in Google Sites for homework.</p>
        <p>I have called it Python Projects and I used it to help my family (including parents!) to code in Python! They followed the instructions to create a Python project in less than 10 miniutes.</p>
        <p>You can open the site using the button below.</p>
        <h2>Leave this site and proceed to the Python Projects website?</h2>
        <button class="yes" onclick="location.href = 'https://sites.google.com/view/pyprojects/';">Yes</button>
        <button class="no" onclick="location.href = 'index.html';">No</button>
