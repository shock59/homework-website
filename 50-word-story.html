        <h1>50 Word Story</h1>
        <p>One homework task given was to write a 50 word story. I have written a 50 word story called <em>The Old Broken Mill</em>. Here it is:</p>
        <div class="info">
            <h2>The Old Broken Mill</h2>
            <h4>A 50 Word Story By Sam Vuckovic</h4>
            <p>One calm and extremely normal day, someone was at the old farm. They were there to see the mill. The old mill was broken, but everyone liked it. Then the blades of the mill broke off and smashed into the ground, so no-one wanted to visit the old mill anymore.</p>
            <h4>THE END</h4>
        </div>
        <p>The story was inspired by this image:</p>
        <img src="images/mill.jpg" alt="Picture of a mill" class="standard" />
