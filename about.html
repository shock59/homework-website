        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This website was created as an extension for a homework assignment to create a website using Google Sites. I have turned it into an area to showcase all my homework for this term.</p>
        <h2>Why I <em>didn't</em> use Google Sites</h2>
        <p>I decided to create a website <em>without</em> Google Sites as a fun challenge for myself. I also made this website with code so I could implement elements that aren't availbale in Google Sites, such as</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="styling.html">custom styling</a></li>
            <li>a wide choice of elements to use</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="info">
            <p>This website was created with <em>HTML code</em>. You can view the code at <a href="https://github.com/shock59/homework-website/" target="_blank">this website</a>.</p>
